# SARS-CoV-2 Deactivator
Effort to make low-cost devices to kill SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus on used disposable personal protective equipment PPE, masks etc. so that they can be re-used to work-around potentially deadly PPE shortages.

# Purpose
Personal protective equipment is generally disposable, and rapidly discarded+destroyed during epidemics to avoid contamination of health workers, and other patients.  The **SARS-CoV-2** virus appears to be suseptible to destruction at relatively low temperatures (e.g. 15 minutes at 56Â°C deactivated **SARS-CoV-1**), making improvised equipment to allow re-use of at least some disposable PPE feasible.
