# SARS-CoV-2 Deactivator

Effort to document heat-oriented processes to deactivate ("kill") the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus (COVID-19) on used "single-use" personal protective equipment PPE, principally medical respirators ("face masks"), which are usually designated as "single use", so that they can be re-used in case of potentially life-endangering PPE equipment shortages.

The initial goal is to collect information on issues and processes involved, to help medics and other hospital professionals who are considering this as part of their contingency planning.

A secondary goal is to make low-cost devices which are capable of carrying out these processes (e.g. for deployment in low / middle income countries, where suitable equipment may be less available).

# Purpose
Personal protective equipment is generally disposable, and rapidly discarded+destroyed during epidemics to avoid contamination of health workers, and other patients.  The **SARS-CoV-2** virus is susceptible to destruction at relatively low temperatures (e.g. 56°C and 60°C are used in testing procedures to deactivated **SARS-CoV-1** and **SARS-CoV-2**), making improvised processes and equipment to allow re-use of at least some disposable PPE feasible.
