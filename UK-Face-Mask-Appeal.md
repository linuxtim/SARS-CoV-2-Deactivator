# UK Dust Mask Appeal

28 March 2020

#### Urgent research to allow safe re-use of disposable hospital breathing masks used to protect medics

## What's needed?

Construction industry "dust masks" - grade **FFP3**, maximum **one new + unused mask** of each manufacturer and model.

One mask of each type (make and model) can be tested next week (up to a max total of six).  Ideally these should match the types used in the NHS closely (we have some information on NHS mask models).

***Please email tim@seoss.co.uk with the make and type of mask you have available.***

***The six most suitable mask types / models will be tested.***

If your mask is suitable, we will ask you to ship it direct to the researcher at **Institute of Occupational Medicine**, Edinburgh.

***Please do not send any masks yet, just email the make/model details***.

We already have donated / offered:

* JSP MARTcare FFP3


# Why?

Lab work carried out in California and The Netherlands this week has determined that at least some medical respirators ("Face masks"), can be successfully heat treated (in order to deactivate the COVID19 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus), **without impacting their filtration efficiency**.

e.g. see https://aim.stanford.edu/covid-19-evidence-service/

If masks can be safely decontaminated, then masks which are usually designated as "single use" (and are now being used at an extremely high rate in hospitals and GPs), could be re-used in case of potentially life-endangering PPE equipment shortages.


A researcher at the Institute of Occupational Medicine, Edinburgh is planning to carry out similar tests next week (w/c 30 March) to ensure that the same processes can be used on a variety of masks which are available in the UK supply chain.

UK hospitals use **P3** grade respirators ("face masks") for high risk areas - ref p24 to p26 in [NHS/Govt guidelines](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/874316/Infection_prevention_and_control_guidance_for_pandemic_coronavirus.pdf).

These masks are very similar to **FFP3** masks commonly used in the construction industry (particularly for fine dust e.g. angle grinding, asbestos removal etc.) - in some cases they are identical, and in other cases the types of valve in the construction industry masks make them unsuitable for medical use (to prevent risk of infection *from* the medic to others).

Although the hospitals can't generally use most construction industry masks, **these experimental tests can use them**.  This is because manufacturers normally make all their P3 masks with the same materials.  They only change the valves and other fittings, and add extra fluid-resistant layers for medical masks.

Next week's tests will focus on the filter media, using lab equipment to ensure that heat treatment doesn't harm the mask's ability to filter out inert particulates the same size as the virus (0.12 to 0.06 thousandths of a millimetre across!).

Here is some earlier (pollution related) research by the same team:

... which gives details of their experimental setup.
