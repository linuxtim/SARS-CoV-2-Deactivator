# UK Face Masks Samples Required for Urgent Research

29 March 2020  Tim Small BSc. (AECB Brighton local group)

#### Research planned for this week (w/c 30 March 2020) to allow safe re-use of disposable hospital breathing masks to protect NHS workers

## What's needed?

Construction and industrial "dust masks" (respirators) - grade ideally **FFP3** (as of yesterday **FFP2** is now approved for NHS use if FFP3 are unavailable), maximum **one** ***unused*** **mask** of each manufacturer and model.

One mask of each type (make and model) can be tested next week (up to **a max total of six**).  Ideally these should match the types used in the NHS closely (we have some information on masks being used in the NHS).

***Please email tim@seoss.co.uk with the make and type of mask you have available.***

***The six most suitable mask types / models will be selected.***

**If your mask is selected**, we will ask you to **ship one mask direct** to the researcher at **Institute of Occupational Medicine**, Edinburgh, for testing towards the end of next week.

***Please do not send any masks yet, just email the make/model details***.

In case you're wondering if this is an elaborate get-masks-for-free scam:

* *We will update this page* to list the offered masks and the names of the people/organisations that have offered them (anonymised if requested).
* The donors will be asked to send the masks directly to IOM, Edinburgh.
* The researcher has had previous work published by the British Medical Journal, and we will send a link to this, along with the request to post.

If you'd prefer to remain anonymous, please let me know the name you'd like to be listed as.

### Current offers

This list will be updated as we have more offers.

* JSP/MARTcare FFP3 "cup moulded" style mask with semi shrouded valve (Tim Small).
* 3M FFP2 "cup moulded" style mask (unknown model number - packaging missing, fully shrouded valve (M.M)).
* FFP2 fold flat style (make/model TBC (M.P).


# Why?

Lab work carried out in California and The Netherlands last week has determined that at least some medical respirators ("Face masks"), can be successfully heat treated to temperatures which are known to deactivate (kill) the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID19) coronavirus, **without damaging the masks' filtration efficiency**.

e.g. see https://aim.stanford.edu/covid-19-evidence-service/

If masks can be safely decontaminated, then masks which are usually designated as "single use" could be re-used in case of potentially life-endangering PPE equipment shortages.  These masks are being used at a very high rate in hospitals and GPs - infection control measures dictate that they are discarded aggressively.

A researcher at the Institute of Occupational Medicine, Edinburgh is planning to carry out similar tests next week (w/c 30 March) to ensure that the same processes can be used on a variety of masks which are available in the UK supply chain.

UK hospitals use **P3** grade respirators ("face masks") for high risk areas - ref p24 to p26 in [NHS/Govt guidelines](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/874316/Infection_prevention_and_control_guidance_for_pandemic_coronavirus.pdf).

These masks are very similar to **FFP3** masks commonly used in the construction industry (particularly for fine dust e.g. angle grinding, asbestos removal etc.) - in some cases they are identical.

Although the hospitals can't use some construction / industrial masks, **these experimental tests can use them**.  This is because manufacturers normally make all their P3 masks with the same filter material.  They only change the valves and other fittings, and add extra fluid-resistant layers for medical masks.

Next week's tests will focus on the filter media, using lab equipment to ensure that heat treatment doesn't harm the masks' ability to filter out particulates the same size as the virus (just 0.12 to 0.06 *thousandths* of a millimetre across!).

Here is some earlier (pollution related) research by the same team:
